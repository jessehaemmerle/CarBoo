# Quick fix for "Could not find required file index.html" error

echo "🔧 Quick Fix: Frontend Build Error"
echo "=================================="

echo "✅ ISSUE IDENTIFIED:"
echo "   The .dockerignore file was excluding the 'public' directory"
echo "   This prevented index.html from being copied during Docker build"

echo ""
echo "✅ SOLUTION APPLIED:"
echo "   - Commented out 'public' line in frontend/.dockerignore"
echo "   - The public directory (containing index.html) is now included in builds"

echo ""
echo "🚀 Ready to deploy! Run one of these commands:"
echo ""
echo "Option 1 - Clean build (recommended):"
echo "   docker-compose down"
echo "   docker-compose up --build"
echo ""
echo "Option 2 - Setup script:"
echo "   ./setup.sh prod"
echo ""
echo "Option 3 - Multi-domain setup:"
echo "   ./domain-manager.sh deploy-fleet"
echo ""

echo "📋 What was fixed:"
echo "   ❌ Before: .dockerignore contained 'public' (excluded index.html)"
echo "   ✅ After:  .dockerignore allows 'public' directory (includes index.html)"

echo ""
echo "🔍 The build should now complete successfully!"
